# ShopiList
#### Shopify Mobile Challenge Winter 2019
<hr>



## Requirement 

Create an iOS app that displays a Tags List Page and a Products List Page. Your app will need to fetch data from the Shopify Products REST API (https://shopicruit.myshopify.com/admin/products.json?page=1&access_token=c32313df0d0ef512ca64d5b336a0d7c6)

- Tags List Page: A simple list of every unique tag that has been added to one of your products (e.g. Aerodynamic, Clock, Concrete). Clicking on a tag launches the Products List Page.

- Products List Page: A list of every product that contains the selected tag. Each row in the list needs to contain, at a minimum, the name of the product and the total available inventory across all variants of the product.


Note that the API link is only for the first page of orders (for this challenge you can ignore any additional pages). Here are a couple simple libraries that you can use to fetch the data (these are optional, you can pick one or use any other alternative).

iOS:
https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/ or just use URLSession

Extra
Feeling adventurous? Show the product image for each row of the Products List Page



What you need to submit:
A screenshot of your app showing the Tags List Page
A screenshot of your app showing the Products List Page after clicking on “Aerodynamic” from the Tags List Page
Your project code.
